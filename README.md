# LSD-Questionnaire

- Prepare a questionnaire with Google Forms to get feedback on the quality of your operation documentation in LSD.
    - Let your questionnaire consist of at maximum 15 items.
    - Choose those items, that deem to be most suitable for this task.
- Send the questionnaire to the team, which is operating your Hacker News Clone project.
- Give the responding team two days to fill out the questionnaire.
- Evaluate the responses that you collected from them.
- In case you realize that the responding team points out issues with your current operation documentation, modify and improve it accordingly.
- Inform the operations team that an improved version of the operations documentation is accessible and point out what you have changed, i.e., provide a changelog.
